<h1>History and Philosophy</h1>


        <p> The History & Philosophy Department prepares students for a lifetime of critical thinking, cooperation, and
            leadership in today's interconnected world through courses that emphasize multicultural and international
            perspectives in disciplines such as history, philosophy, geography, and religious studies. The degrees
            offered by the department encourage students to engage with the breadth of human experience while instilling
            a commitment to build a more just and sustainable future. </p>
