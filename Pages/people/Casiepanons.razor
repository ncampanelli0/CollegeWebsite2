<h1>Chemistry and Physics<h1>

        <p> The Chemistry department is an important asset for students who enter the biological or health science
            fields. Chemistry is a vital tool for understanding the human body, biological life, and the physical
            interaction of substances throughout science.

            All students seeking to enhance their studies are encouraged to complete an academic minor to complement
            their bachelor's degree. The Chemistry department offers a minor in Chemistry allowing students to
            incorporate a study of chemistry into their academic background, making students' credentials more
            marketable during their employment search. </p>
