        <p>The American Studies Department offers students two distinct but interconnected undergraduate majors --
            American Studies and Media & Communications -- along with a graduate degree in Liberal Studies.

            Our programs develop within students an enhanced understanding of the meanings of citizenship and foster a
            critical understanding of events and issues defining the nation in the past and present. </p>
